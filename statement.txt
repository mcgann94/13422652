I have fully achieved part 1.
I have made progress in part 2 however I dont feel it is
correct what I have done and it's incomplete.
I have fully completed part 3 where it takes in all of
the curlers and depending on the list you want to display,
displays the elite curlers with efficiency 10.(I made it 10 in testing)
I didnt get a chance to attempt q4 as my part 2 wasnt correct. I
have a fair idea of how I would go about it though.
